# sdl2-test

a simple sdl2 project

its basically a playground for myself to get used to some things in C and have at least some visual suggar :)

good place to start with sdl2: https://wiki.libsdl.org/


## acknowledgement

Again, this is just here so i have a place to store it, there are no means of making that usefull to someone else!!!


Since this a simple test for myself i didnt bother to much with running through stuff when i picked the image for the background. So if someone has a problem with that i will take it off github. I simply wanted to have a layout to try stuff out.
