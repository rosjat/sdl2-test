# sdl2-test

a simple sdl2 project

its basically a playground for myself to get used to some things in C and have at least some visual sugar :)

**BE AWARE: I try to leave the code in a state where it builds and runs, but this doesnt mean it does what i intended to do!**

good place to start with sdl2: https://wiki.libsdl.org/

### Update 2021/3/21

 - moved event handling into seperate function (this might happen with all the main parts like event handling or redraw)
 - made some simple init functions for rects in the blocks , screens and stage
 - adding simply physics for jumping 
 
### Update 2021/3/20

 - added some structs to work with object and "screens", I need to refactor things if it should turn into something "playable"
 - added a color key so i can have opacity 
 - added simple collition detection for the added objects, the way that those objects are added needs to be made easier(maybe config file)


## Acknowledgement

Again, this is just here so i have a place to store it, there are no means of making that usefull to someone else!!!


Since this a simple test for myself i didnt bother to much with running through stuff when i picked the image for the background. So if someone has a problem with that i will take it off github. I simply wanted to have a layout to try stuff out.
